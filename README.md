We gonna build a crowdfund project for web3, like https://www.kickstarter.com/ in web2. The project can help People in web3 to quickly crowdfund seed money in the way of crypto-curreny to start their project.   At the beginning, we will target film producers, who needs some seed fund to create a short video movie.



Funding on blockfundr operates on an "all-or-nothing" model, which means that project creators only receive ETH funds if they reach or exceed their funding goal within a specified timeframe. Here's a detailed breakdown of how this model works:



How All-or-Nothing Funding Works on blockfundr
Project Creation and Goal Setting:

Project Page: Video creators set up a detailed project page e.g, a video, and a clear outline of what they aim to film.

Funding Goal: Creators set a financial goal that represents the minimum amount of ETH needed to complete their video project.
Deadline: A deadline is set, usually between 1 and 60 days, during which the project must reach its funding goal.


All-or-Nothing Funding Principle:

Goal Met: If the project reaches or exceeds its funding goal by the deadline, all pledged funds are collected from backers. The creator receives the funds (minus blockfundr's fees and payment processing fees) and proceeds with the project.

Goal Not Met: If the project does not reach its funding goal, no funds are collected from backers. Backers are not charged, and the creator does not receive any funds.


Advantages of All-or-Nothing Funding
Risk Reduction: For backers, the all-or-nothing model reduces the risk of funding projects that might not have enough resources to be completed. It ensures that only projects with sufficient backing proceed.

Motivation for Creators: Creators are incentivized to actively promote their campaigns and reach their funding goals, ensuring they are fully committed to their projects.
Credibility: Projects that reach their funding goals often gain more credibility and attract additional support, as they demonstrate clear demand and feasibility.

Example Scenario
Imagine a creator wants to fund a new board game and sets a funding goal of $50,000 with a 30-day campaign:

Day 1-29: The creator promotes the project heavily. Backers pledge varying amounts, enticed by different reward tiers.
Day 30: The campaign ends, having raised $55,000.
Successful Funding: Because the goal of $50,000 was exceeded, all $55,000 is collected from backers. blockfundr takes its fees (approximately 5% platform fee and gas fee), and the remaining funds go to the creator to develop the board game.
Updates: The creator keeps backers informed through updates, sharing progress and any challenges encountered.
Conversely, if only $45,000 were pledged by day 30, no funds would be collected, and backers would not be charged. The creator might then reevaluate the campaign, seek feedback, and possibly relaunch with a new strategy.

Key Points for Creators
Set Realistic Goals: Ensure the funding goal is realistic and covers all necessary costs.

Engage with Backers: Regularly update and engage with backers to maintain interest and trust.
By understanding and leveraging the all-or-nothing funding model, creators can effectively use blockfundr to bring their projects to life with the assurance of having sufficient resources to deliver on their promises.




Types of Rewards

1: Blockfundr will generate NFT for the video the creator completes, the NFT will represent the video, the earlier backers can receive more NFTS.

2: Creator can also define rewards for each backers at the beginning, e.g, if a movie producer has created a short video or movie from blockfundr, he can share some profits he makes from other platforms.
